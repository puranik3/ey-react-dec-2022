## Accessing the server(s) used in the training
We shall use this backend server in the training - http://workshops-server.herokuapp.com/ (workshops app)  
You can access the data via various endpoints. For example, to retrieve the sessions for the workshop with id = 2, we can hit the endpoint...
```
http://workshops-server.herokuapp.com/workshops/2/sessions
```
